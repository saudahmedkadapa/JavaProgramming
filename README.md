# JavaProgramming
Key Concepts in Core Java:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Classes and Objects: Core building blocks of Java programs.
Inheritance: Mechanism to reuse code and create relationships between classes.
Polymorphism: Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
Encapsulation: Keeping fields within a class private and providing access through public methods.
Basic Syntax and Constructs:

Data Types: Primitive types (int, char, boolean) and reference types (objects).
Control Statements: If-else, switch, loops (for, while), etc.
Exception Handling: Try-catch blocks, throw, throws, and custom exceptions for error handling.
Collections Framework:

Lists, Sets, Maps: Data structures like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap to store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.
Iterators: To traverse collections.
Multithreading:

Thread Class and Runnable Interface: Creating and managing multiple threads to execute tasks concurrently.
Synchronization: Ensuring thread safety when multiple threads interact with shared resources.
Java Input/Output (I/O):

Streams: For reading from and writing to files, consoles, and other I/O sources.
Serialization: Converting an objectâ€™s state into a byte stream to store or transmit.
Memory Management:

Garbage Collection: Automatic memory management that reclaims memory from objects no longer in use.
Heap and Stack: Memory areas used for dynamic memory allocation and method execution.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine):

Platform Independence: Bytecode compiled by the Java compiler runs on any machine that has a JVM.
ClassLoader: Loads classes dynamically at runtime.
JIT Compiler: Optimizes bytecode into machine code for faster execution.
